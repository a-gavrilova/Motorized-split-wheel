# Motorized-split-wheel

I study Purkinje cells activity in cereblelum of mice undergoing locomotion adaptation task. I designed a behavioral setup consisting of 2 motorized wheels and head-fixation system. This method can be combined with various methods, allowing to record neuronal activity, such as regular two-photon calcium imaging, voltage imaging and electrophysioogical recordings. 

Here is the hardware & software developed for such behavioral setup.
